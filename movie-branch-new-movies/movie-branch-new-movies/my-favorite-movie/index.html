    <h2>Why this is such a good movie</h2>
    <p>Star wars:a new hope was a movie written and directed by George Lucas, it was released on the 27th of october in 1977.
        With a measely budget of 11 million USD the movie was a huge succes as it has received a 93% on rotten tomatoes and a 8.6 on IMDB.
        Although this movie had it's flaws, George Lucas still managed to create an amazing story and put it on camera. </p>

    <p>This movie was a staple in cinematic history, as this movie gave birth to one of the if not the biggest franchise in human history.
       For this achievement alone it should be respected as is. Another funny part about this movie is that it has been released in many versions,
       the first version differing immensly from the latest version. To give an example, they covered up the entire stance of Jabba the Hutt with an
       enormous slug because the original human actor landed in jail. As Han Solo said: "You are an amazing human being.".
